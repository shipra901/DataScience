Comprehensive,A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT,"Yihan Cao, Siyu Li, Yixin Liu, Zhiling Yan, Yutong Dai, Philip S. Yu, Lichao Sun",7-Mar-23,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04226,2303.04226,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG","Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC."
Comprehensive,Language Model Behavior: A Comprehensive Survey,"Tyler A. Chang, Benjamin K. Bergen",20-Mar-23,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11504,2303.11504,cs.CL,"Transformer language models have received widespread public attention, yet their generated text is often surprising even to NLP researchers. In this survey, we discuss over 250 recent studies of English language model behavior before task-specific fine-tuning. Language models possess basic capabilities in syntax, semantics, pragmatics, world knowledge, and reasoning, but these capabilities are sensitive to specific inputs and surface features. Despite dramatic increases in generated text quality as models scale to hundreds of billions of parameters, the models are still prone to unfactual responses, commonsense errors, memorized text, and social biases. Many of these weaknesses can be framed as over-generalizations or under-generalizations of learned patterns in text. We synthesize recent results to highlight what is currently known about large language model capabilities, thus providing a resource for applied work and for research in adjacent fields that use language models."
Comprehensive,A Survey of Large Language Models,"Wayne Xin Zhao, Kun Zhou, Junyi Li, Tianyi Tang, Xiaolei Wang, Yupeng Hou, Yingqian Min, Beichen Zhang, Junjie Zhang, Zican Dong, Yifan Du, Chen Yang, Yushuo Chen, Zhipeng Chen, Jinhao Jiang, Ruiyang Ren, Yifan Li, Xinyu Tang, Zikang Liu, Peiyu Liu, Jian-Yun Nie, Ji-Rong Wen",31-Mar-23,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223,2303.18223,"cs.CL, cs.AI","Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions."

However, a major challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on evaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and regulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs. To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key dimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The survey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability, safety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence to social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into several sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories. Additionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further investigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and conducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that, in general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall trustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the different trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance of conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous improvements on LLM alignment.

Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies.

The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks.

The disadvantage is exacerbated when new knowledge frequently needs to be introduced into the pre-trained model. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective and efficient techniques to update pre-trained LLMs. Traditional methods encode new knowledge in pre-trained LLMs through direct fine-tuning.

However, most of them have been evaluated under noise-free context and the dilemma for LLMs to produce inaccurate results under the noisy context has not been fully investigated. Existing studies utilize trigger sentences to encourage LLMs to concentrate on the relevant information but the trigger has limited effect on final answer prediction. Inspired by interactive CoT method, where intermediate reasoning steps are promoted by multiple rounds of interaction between users and LLMs, we propose a novel prompting method, namely R$^3$ prompting, for CoT reasoning under noisy context. Specifically, R$^3$ prompting interacts with LLMs to perform key sentence extraction, variable declaration and answer prediction, which corresponds to a thought process of reviewing, rephrasing and resolving. The responses generated at the last interaction will perform as hints to guide toward the responses of the next interaction. Our experiments show that R$^3$ prompting significantly outperforms existing CoT prompting methods on five reasoning tasks under noisy context. With GPT-3.5-turbo, we observe 3.7% accuracy improvement on average on the reasoning tasks under noisy context compared to the most competitive prompting baseline.

Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these topics.

While LLMs are powerful, it is also crucial to best use their power where ""prompt'' plays a core role. However, the booming LLMs themselves, including excellent APIs like ChatGPT, have several inherent limitations: 1) temporal lag of training data, and 2) the lack of physical capabilities to perform external actions. Recently, we have observed the trend of utilizing prompt-based tools to better utilize the power of LLMs for downstream tasks, but a lack of systematic literature and standardized terminology, partly due to the rapid evolution of this field. Therefore, in this work, we survey related prompting tools and promote the concept of the ""Prompting Framework"" (PF), i.e. the framework for managing, simplifying, and facilitating interaction with large language models. We define the lifecycle of the PF as a hierarchical structure, from bottom to top, namely: Data Level, Base Level, Execute Level, and Service Level. We also systematically depict the overall landscape of the emerging PF field and discuss potential future research and challenges. To continuously track the developments in this area, we maintain a repository at https://github.com/lxx0628/Prompting-Framework-Survey, which can be a useful resource sharing platform for both academic and industry in this field."

Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency, and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-3/4), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process.

A case study using a company descriptions dataset offers insight into the differences between the GPT-3.5 and the specialized SDG detection model. While GPT-3.5 boasts broader coverage, it may identify SDGs with limited relevance to the companies' activities. In contrast, the specialized model zeroes in on highly pertinent SDGs. The importance of thoughtful model selection is emphasized, taking into account task requirements, cost, complexity, and transparency. Despite the versatility of LLMs, the use of specialized models is suggested for tasks demanding precision and accuracy. The study concludes by encouraging further research to find a balance between the capabilities of LLMs and the need for domain-specific expertise and interpretability."

M Towhidul Islam Tonmoy, S M Mehedi Zaman, Vinija Jain, Anku Rani, Vipula Rawte, Aman Chadha, Amitava Das",2-Jan-24,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01313,2401.01313,cs.CL,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs."

This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions. Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions. Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics. We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets. Our findings firstly show that in general trustworthiness and utility (i.e., functional effectiveness) are positively related. Secondly, our observations reveal that proprietary LLMs generally outperform most open-source counterparts in terms of trustworthiness, raising concerns about the potential risks of widely accessible open-source LLMs. However, a few open-source LLMs come very close to proprietary ones. Thirdly, it is important to note that some LLMs may be overly calibrated towards exhibiting trustworthiness, to the extent that they compromise their utility by mistakenly treating benign prompts as harmful and consequently not responding. Finally, we emphasize the importance of ensuring transparency not only in the models themselves but also in the technologies that underpin trustworthiness.

A natural thought is to utilize these abilities to empower autonomous driving. By combining LLM with foundation vision models, it could open the door to open-world understanding, reasoning, and few-shot learning, which current autonomous driving systems are lacking. In this paper, we systematically review a research line about \textit{Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD)}. This study evaluates the current state of technological advancements, distinctly outlining the principal challenges and prospective directions for the field. For the convenience of researchers in academia and industry, we provide real-time updates on the latest advances in the field as well as relevant open-source resources via the designated link: https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Awesome-LLM4AD."

However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolving by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions."

Some researchers suggest that LLMs could potentially replace structured knowledge bases like knowledge graphs (KGs) and function as parameterized knowledge bases. However, while LLMs are proficient at learning probabilistic language patterns based on large corpus and engaging in conversations with humans, they, like previous smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), still have difficulty in recalling facts while generating knowledge-grounded contents. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed enhancing data-driven PLMs with knowledge-based KGs to incorporate explicit factual knowledge into PLMs, thus improving their performance to generate texts requiring factual knowledge and providing more informed responses to user queries. This paper reviews the studies on enhancing PLMs with KGs, detailing existing knowledge graph enhanced pre-trained language models (KGPLMs) as well as their applications.

Finance,Large Language Models in Finance: A Survey,"Yinheng Li, Shaofei Wang, Han Ding, Hang Chen",28-Sep-23,https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10723,2311.10723,"cs.AI, cs.CL","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for artificial intelligence applications in finance. In this paper, we provide a practical survey focused on two key aspects of utilizing LLMs for financial tasks: existing solutions and guidance for adoption.   First, we review current approaches employing LLMs in finance, including leveraging pretrained models via zero-shot or few-shot learning, fine-tuning on domain-specific data, and training custom LLMs from scratch. We summarize key models and evaluate their performance improvements on financial natural language processing tasks.   Second, we propose a decision framework to guide financial professionals in selecting the appropriate LLM solution based on their use case constraints around data, compute, and performance needs. The framework provides a pathway from lightweight experimentation to heavy investment in customized LLMs.   Lastly, we discuss limitations and challenges around leveraging LLMs in financial applications. Overall, this survey aims to synthesize the state-of-the-art and provide a roadmap for responsibly applying LLMs to advance financial AI."

The underlying technology is keyto further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large languagemodels are here to stay.  This position paper presents the potential benefits and challenges of educationalapplications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the currentstate of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to createeducational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. Withregard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to developsets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations andunexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clearpedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required tointegrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Otherchallenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potentialfor misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, thesechallenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potentialsocietal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to addressthese challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education."
Hardware Architecture,A Survey on Hardware Accelerators for Large Language Models,Christoforos Kachris,18-Jan-24,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09890,2401.0989,"cs.AR, cs.CL, cs.LG","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks, revolutionizing the field with their ability to understand and generate human-like text. As the demand for more sophisticated LLMs continues to grow, there is a pressing need to address the computational challenges associated with their scale and complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on hardware accelerators designed to enhance the performance and energy efficiency of Large Language Models. By examining a diverse range of accelerators, including GPUs, FPGAs, and custom-designed architectures, we explore the landscape of hardware solutions tailored to meet the unique computational demands of LLMs. The survey encompasses an in-depth analysis of architecture, performance metrics, and energy efficiency considerations, providing valuable insights for researchers, engineers, and decision-makers aiming to optimize the deployment of LLMs in real-world applications."

Recently, the extensive success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has raised significant attention about how knowledge can be acquired, maintained, updated and used by language models. Despite the enormous amount of related studies, there still lacks a unified view of how knowledge circulates within language models throughout the learning, tuning, and application processes, which may prevent us from further understanding the connections between current progress or realizing existing limitations. In this survey, we revisit PLMs as knowledge-based systems by dividing the life circle of knowledge in PLMs into five critical periods, and investigating how knowledge circulates when it is built, maintained and used. To this end, we systematically review existing studies of each period of the knowledge life cycle, summarize the main challenges and current limitations, and discuss future directions."

Due to the recent growth of the field, many of these fundamental attributes lack systematic description. We gather, annotate, and analyze a new dataset of 16,979 LLM-related arXiv papers, focusing on changes in 2023 vs. 2018-2022. We show that LLM research increasingly focuses on societal impacts: the Computers and Society sub-arXiv has seen 20x growth in its proportion of LLM-related papers in 2023. This change is driven in part by an influx of new authors: a majority of 2023 papers are first-authored by researchers who have not previously written an LLM-related paper, and these papers focus particularly on applications and societal considerations. While a handful of companies hold outsize influence, academia publishes a much larger fraction of papers than industry overall, and this gap widens in 2023. LLM research is also being shaped by social dynamics: there are gender and academic/industry differences in the topics authors prioritize, and a stark U.S./China schism in the collaboration network. Overall, our analysis documents how LLM research both shapes and is shaped by society, attesting to the necessity of sociotechnical lenses; we discuss implications for researchers and policymakers."
Others,Document Automation Architectures: Updated Survey in Light of Large Language Models,"Mohammad Ahmadi Achachlouei, Omkar Patil, Tarun Joshi, Vijayan N. Nair",18-Aug-23,https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09341,2308.09341,"cs.CL, cs.LG","This paper surveys the current state of the art in document automation (DA). The objective of DA is to reduce the manual effort during the generation of documents by automatically creating and integrating input from different sources and assembling documents conforming to defined templates. There have been reviews of commercial solutions of DA, particularly in the legal domain, but to date there has been no comprehensive review of the academic research on DA architectures and technologies. The current survey of DA reviews the academic literature and provides a clearer definition and characterization of DA and its features, identifies state-of-the-art DA architectures and technologies in academic research, and provides ideas that can lead to new research opportunities within the DA field in light of recent advances in generative AI and large language models."
Others,When Large Language Models Meet Citation: A Survey,"Yang Zhang, Yufei Wang, Kai Wang, Quan Z. Sheng, Lina Yao, Adnan Mahmood, Wei Emma Zhang, Rongying Zhao",18-Sep-23,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09727,2309.09727,"cs.DL, cs.CL","Citations in scholarly work serve the essential purpose of acknowledging and crediting the original sources of knowledge that have been incorporated or referenced. Depending on their surrounding textual context, these citations are used for different motivations and purposes. Large Language Models (LLMs) could be helpful in capturing these fine-grained citation information via the corresponding textual context, thereby enabling a better understanding towards the literature. Furthermore, these citations also establish connections among scientific papers, providing high-quality inter-document relationships and human-constructed knowledge. Such information could be incorporated into LLMs pre-training and improve the text representation in LLMs. Therefore, in this paper, we offer a preliminary review of the mutually beneficial relationship between LLMs and citation analysis. Specifically, we review the application of LLMs for in-text citation analysis tasks, including citation classification, citation-based summarization, and citation recommendation. We then summarize the research pertinent to leveraging citation linkage knowledge to improve text representations of LLMs via citation prediction, network structure information, and inter-document relationship. We finally provide an overview of these contemporary methods and put forth potential promising avenues in combining LLMs and citation analysis for further investigation."

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the attribution mechanisms employed by these systems, particularly large language models. Though attribution or citation improve the factuality and verifiability, issues like ambiguous knowledge reservoirs, inherent biases, and the drawbacks of excessive attribution can hinder the effectiveness of these systems. The aim of this survey is to provide valuable insights for researchers, aiding in the refinement of attribution methodologies to enhance the reliability and veracity of responses generated by open-domain generative systems. We believe that this field is still in its early stages; hence, we maintain a repository to keep track of ongoing studies at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/awesome-llm-attributions."
